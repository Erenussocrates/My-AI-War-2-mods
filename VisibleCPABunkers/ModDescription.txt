In the base game, it's pretty hard to keep track of the CPA Bunkers, if you've ever played with them. If they appear on the planets that you've already discovered, they don't become visible on the galaxy view, because they are an enemy structure. This mod makes them become visible in explored planets in the galaxy view at all times, so you don't forget about a bunker in some corner of the galaxy.
