It always bothered me how the player couldn't gain anything from holding a system with a Dyson Sphere in it, even though it's supposed to be a structure that is so potent that it creates nearly limitless energy.
With this mod, the player will be able to draw 2m power from
a Dyson Sphere for as long as they can hold a Command Station on the same planet. 

I especially thank Dismiss for help in creating this, as it would be fair to say that he made 90% of the actual content, as without him, this mod would have probably been either impossible or of a much weaker quality, since he was the one who coded in a brand new tag to be used in the configuration, and all I did was adding that new tag in my mod.
