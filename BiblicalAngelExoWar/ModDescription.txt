This mod requires all the DLCs.

"Apostoles. Emissaries of God. Our enemies, that have names of angels."
-Shinji Ikari

This mod just changes the names of 40+ Exogalactic War Front units into biblically accurate angel and demon names, it's just for cosmetic flair.

Maybe the humanity wanted to name their strongest previously-thought-to-be-allies after their biblical protectors before they decided to turn their weapons on their own masters?

Maybe the AI has a god complex and that's why they named their most powerful minions after the angels?

Or maybe you are a Neon Genesis Evangelion fan, and really like the idea of potentially world-ending AI agents named after the angels.

In any case, be prepared to feel the fear of seeing something unfamiliar and scary, all over again.

If you have the mod "ExoWar Overhaul" by Lord of Nothing enabled, this mod will also rename the newly introduced exowar units by that mod too.
